# WAO Clients

We're pleased to work with clients on complex projects that require radical collaboration and innovative ideas. This repo is our attempt to collect overviews of these projects. 

* [Client entries are in the wiki](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki)

Our projects tend to be somewhere in the intersections of Learning, Technology and Community:

-   **Learning**: We build learning experiences of all shapes and sizes. We spent three years working closely with [Greenpeace](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki/Greenpeace) International on a robust internal learning programme and ran multiple learning events for over 50 charities through [Catalyst](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki/Catalyst). We've helped Change.org run their staff event with participatory methodologies and helped [CIPD](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki/CIPD) develop their professional development strategy. New processes, technology, ideas require a bit of getting used to, so there's always room for learning initiatives.
-   **Technology**: We know tech. Whatever the problem, we can advise on how to use technology and process to solve it. We've helped the [Digital Credentials Consortium](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki/DCC) create pathways in and around their technologies, and we've taught the national governing bodies of [Sport England](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki/Sport-England) how to use new tools and open principles to increase impact. We have built digital strategies for Greenpeace International, [Julie's Bicycle](/clients/juliesbicycle), and more.
-   **Community**: People make or break a project, so we help build healthy, equitable communities to advance your vision. We've helped open source communities like [LocalGov Drupal](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki/LocalGov-Drupal) recognise their contributors, partner with [Participate](/clients/participate) to ensure that various badges communities are connected, and helped [Passbolt](https://github.com/weareopen/clients/wiki/Passbolt) establish and then engage with their growing community.

When we start a new project, we get to know our clients using a variety of discovery techniques. Depending on the scale of the project or its complexity we might recommend a [Thinkathon](https://github.com/weareopen/AllTheThings/wiki/Misc#wtf-is-a-thinkathon) in which we seek to map the complexity of your project, organisation and context. We’ll use open approaches to provide a different, connected approach to the problems your organisation is trying to solve. We’ll design and deliver both the strategy and the tactics by working hand-in-hand with you and your colleagues. We don’t work ‘for’ you, we work **with** you.
